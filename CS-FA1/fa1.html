	      <p>Here you will find that Family Medicine not only treats acute health issues but also focuses on 
			long-term health and prevention. This specialty promotes sustained physician-patient relationships 
			so that care can be tailored with attention to the social, emotional, and physical dimensions of health. 
			Moreover, the varied training and exposures provided by Family Medicine equip doctors to manage complicated 
			cases and traverse a myriad of healthcare challenges, making them fundamental in the functioning of the 
			entire healthcare system.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			In reality, Family Medicine is not so much a vocation but a vocation for an inclusive care of populations and 
			individuals, a call that promises a rewarding and engaging career for those who undertake this practice.

	      <h2>“The Little Drawing”</h2>
	      <p>Dr. Alvarez started her clinic day running late. The waiting room was full, the phone kept ringing, and her coffee had gone cold long before she could drink it. Her next appointment was with a 6-year-old named Emily — a quiet girl who’d been coming in for stomachaches for months. Every test had come back normal.</p>
	      <p>When Dr. Alvarez entered the room that morning, Emily was sitting on the exam table, holding a crumpled drawing. Her mother looked tired. “It’s her stomach again,” she said softly.</p>
		  <p>Instead of jumping straight into questions about pain or diet, Dr. Alvarez crouched beside the child and asked, “Can I see your picture?”</p>
		  <p>Emily hesitated, then handed it over. It showed a stick figure family — mom, dad, and Emily — but the father was drawn far away in a corner, behind a big gray wall.</p>
		  <p>Gently, Dr. Alvarez asked, “Who’s this?”<br>Emily whispered, “That’s my dad. He’s in jail. I miss him.”</p>
		  <p>That moment shifted everything. The doctor realized the “stomachaches” were really anxiety and grief. She connected the family with a counselor, checked in weekly, and helped Emily’s mother find support services.</p>
		  <p>Months later, Emily came running into the clinic for a routine check-up — laughing, smiling, holding another drawing. This one showed her family together again, the gray wall gone.</p>
